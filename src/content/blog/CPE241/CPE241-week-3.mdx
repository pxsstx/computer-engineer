## Sensors and actuators

**Sensors and actuators** are fundamental components in various systems, especially in automation, robotics, and electronics. Here’s a brief overview of each:

### Sensors

- Definition: Sensors are devices that detect and measure physical properties or environmental conditions and convert them into signals or data that can be read and interpreted by other systems.

- Function: Sensors collect information about the surrounding environment or the status of a system. They can measure a wide range of variables such as temperature, pressure, light, motion, humidity, and more.

**Examples:**

- Temperature Sensor: Measures temperature and converts it into an electrical signal.
- Proximity Sensor: Detects the presence or absence of an object within a certain range.
- Light Sensor: Measures light intensity and provides data that can be used to adjust lighting systems.

### Actuators

- Definition: Actuators are devices that take signals or commands from a control system and convert them into physical action or movement.

- Function: Actuators execute commands to change the state of a system based on the input received, such as moving a part, opening a valve, or adjusting a position.

**Examples:**

- Electric Motor: Converts electrical energy into rotational motion.
- Solenoid: Uses an electromagnetic field to create linear motion.
- Hydraulic Actuator: Uses hydraulic fluid to produce movement in a hydraulic system.

### Relationship Between Sensors and Actuators

- Sensors provide the data or feedback that informs the control system about the current state or conditions of a system.
- Actuators perform actions based on the control signals or commands derived from sensor data.

> In a typical automated system, sensors gather information about the environment or system state, and this data is processed by a controller. The controller then sends commands to actuators to perform specific actions, thereby adjusting or controlling the system as needed.

## Project 1

### DHT22

**Pinout of DHT22:**

- **VCC**: Connect to 5V
- **GND**: Connect to GND
- **DATA**: Connect to a digital pin on the borad (e.g., pin 2)
- **NC**: No connection (this pin is not used)

**Install the DHT Sensor Library:**

- Go to the Arduino IDE.
- Navigate to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
- Search for **DHT sensor library** by Adafruit and install it.
- Search for **Adafruit Unified Sensor** by Adafruit and install it.

```c
#include "DHT.h"

#define DHTPIN D4
#define DHTTYPE DHT22

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  float h = dht.readHumidity();
  float t = dht.readTemperature();
  float f = dht.readTemperature(true);

  Serial.print("Humidity: ");
  Serial.print(h);
  Serial.print("% Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(t);
  Serial.print("°C ");
  Serial.print(f);
  Serial.println("°F");

  delay(2000);

}
```

## Project 2

### HR-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors

**Pinout of HC-SR04**

- **VCC**: Connect to 5V
- **GND**: Connect to GND
- **TRIG**: Trigger pin to send the pulse
- **ECHO**: Echo pin to receive the pulse

```c
#define trigPin D4
#define echoPin D3

long duration;
long distance;

void setup() {
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);

  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  distance = duration / 58;

  Serial.print("Distance : ");
  Serial.println(distance);
  delay(2000);
}

```

## Project 3

### LDR Light sensor analog

**Pin of LDR :**

- **One side of the LDR** goes to **3.3V** (VCC) of the ESP8266.
- **One side of the fixed resistor** connects to the **GND** (Gnd) pin on the ESP8266.
- **The other side of the LDR** connects to one side of the fixed resistor and also to the **Analog input pin (A0)** of the ESP8266.

```c
#define LDR A0

void setup() {
  pinMode(LDR, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(115200);
}
void loop() {
  int dt;
  dt = analogRead(LDR);
  Serial.print("intensity = ");
  Serial.println(dt);

  delay(1000);
}
```

## Project 4

### Light Sensor BH1750

**Pin of Connections for BH1750**

- **VCC** to **3.3V** (or **5V** if your sensor supports it, but using 3.3V is safer for the ESP8266).
- **GND** to **GND** on the ESP8266.
- **SDA** to **D2** (GPIO4) on the ESP8266.
- **SCL** to **D1** (GPIO5) on the ESP8266.

**Install the DHT Sensor Library:**

- Go to the Arduino IDE.
- Navigate to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
- Search for **BH1750** by Christopher Laws and install it.

```c
#include <Wire.h>
#include <BH1750.h>

BH1750 lightMeter;

#define SDA D2
#define SCL D1

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Wire.begin(SDA, SCL);
  lightMeter.begin();
}
void loop() {
  float lux = lightMeter.readLightLevel();
  Serial.print("Light: ");
  Serial.print(lux);
  Serial.println(" lx");
  delay(1000);
}
```
