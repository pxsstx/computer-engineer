The **ESP8266** is a low-cost, highly integrated microcontroller designed for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. Here are some key features and details about the ESP8266:

## Key Features:

### Wi-Fi Connectivity:

* Built-in 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, compliant with IEEE 802.11 b/g/n standards.
* Capable of operating in both station (STA) and access point (AP) modes.

### Processing Power:

* Powered by a 32-bit Tensilica Xtensa LX106 RISC microprocessor.
* Operating frequency ranges from 80 MHz to 160 MHz.

### Memory:

* 32 KB of instruction RAM and 80 KB of user data RAM.
* External flash memory can be used to extend storage.

### I/O Capabilities:

* 16 GPIO pins for general-purpose input/output.
* Integrated UART, SPI, I²C, I²S, and PWM interfaces for various communication protocols.
* ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) with 10-bit resolution.

### Power Management:

* Low power consumption, making it suitable for battery-powered applications.
* Sleep modes to conserve energy.

### Software:

* Programmable using the Arduino IDE, MicroPython, or custom firmware like NodeMCU.
* Supports TCP/IP stack for internet communication.

### **ESP8266 Modules:**
