title: Input in c language

In C programming, **input** typically refers to reading data from the user or another source. The most common way to get input from the user is using functions like **scanf** or **fgets**. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to use these functions:

# Variables

* int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
* float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
* char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes

## Project 1

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    char c1,c2;
    c1 = 'a';
    c2 = 'A';
    printf("\n c1 = %c and ASCII value c1 = %d",c1,c1);
    printf("\n c2 = %c and ASCII value c1 = %d",c2,c2);
}
```

Output :

```plaintext
c1 = a and ASCII value c1 = 97
c2 = A and ASCII value c1 = 65
```

## Project 2

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int banana = 5;
    int orange = 10;
    int total = banana + orange;

    printf("%d banana and %d orange\n",banana,orange);
    printf("I have %d fruits in total",total);
}
```

Output :

```plaintext
5 banana and 10 orange
I have 15 fruits in total
```

---

## Project 3

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    float PI = 3.14;
    float r = 2.2;
    float result;
    result = 2 * PI * r;

    printf("cricmference is %f",result);
}

```

Output :

```plaintext
cricmference is 13.816001
```

---

## Project 4

```c

#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int length = 15;
    float width = 3.3;
    float total = length * width;

    printf("Square has an area of %f",total);
}

```

Output :

```plaintext
Square has an area of 49.500000
```
