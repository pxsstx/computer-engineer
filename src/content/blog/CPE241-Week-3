## Sensors and actuators are fundamental components in various systems, especially in automation, robotics, and electronics. Here’s a brief overview of each:

###Sensors
- Definition: Sensors are devices that detect and measure physical properties or environmental conditions and convert them into signals or data that can be read and interpreted by other systems.

- Function: Sensors collect information about the surrounding environment or the status of a system. They can measure a wide range of variables such as temperature, pressure, light, motion, humidity, and more.

#### Examples:

- Temperature Sensor: Measures temperature and converts it into an electrical signal.
- Proximity Sensor: Detects the presence or absence of an object within a certain range.
- Light Sensor: Measures light intensity and provides data that can be used to adjust lighting systems.

### Actuators
- Definition: Actuators are devices that take signals or commands from a control system and convert them into physical action or movement.

- Function: Actuators execute commands to change the state of a system based on the input received, such as moving a part, opening a valve, or adjusting a position.

#### Examples:

- Electric Motor: Converts electrical energy into rotational motion.
- Solenoid: Uses an electromagnetic field to create linear motion.
- Hydraulic Actuator: Uses hydraulic fluid to produce movement in a hydraulic system.

### Relationship Between Sensors and Actuators
- Sensors provide the data or feedback that informs the control system about the current state or conditions of a system.
- Actuators perform actions based on the control signals or commands derived from sensor data.

> In a typical automated system, sensors gather information about the environment or system state, and this data is processed by a controller. The controller then sends commands to actuators to perform specific actions, thereby adjusting or controlling the system as needed.

## Porject 1
```c
#include "DHT.h"

#define DHTPIN D4
#define DHTTYPE DHT22

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  float h = dht.readHumidity();
  float t = dht.readTemperature();
  float f = dht.readTemperature(true);

  Serial.print("Humidity: ");
  Serial.print(h);
  Serial.print("% Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(t);
  Serial.print("°C ");
  Serial.print(f);
  Serial.println("°F");

  delay(2000);

}
