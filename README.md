# Blog Template

This project is a fork of the [Blog Template](https://github.com/danielcgilibert/blog-template) created by Daniel C. Gilibert. It serves as a starting point for building a customizable blog with modern web technologies.

## Features

- Responsive design
- Easy customization
- Lightweight and fast

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pxsstx/computer-engineer.git
   cd blog-template
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To run the project locally, use the following command:
```bash
   npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view your blog at http://localhost:4321.

## Customization
You can customize the template to fit your needs:

- Components: Modify the React components in the src/components directory to add, remove, or change the structure of your blog.
Styles: Tailwind CSS is used for styling. You can adjust the design by editing the classes directly in the JSX files or by extending Tailwind in the tailwind.config.js file.
- Content: Add your markdown files to the content directory to create new blog posts. The project uses a static site generator to render the content dynamically.
Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas to improve this template or want to report a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
